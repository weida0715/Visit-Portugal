					<div class="title0" id="sou1">1. Cork products from Portugal</div>
					<div class="paragraph0">One of the most quintessential souvenirs in Portugal is cork products. Being one of the world’s largest producers of cork, it’s no wonder Portugal has turned this material into countless products.
					Portugal cork bags, cork handbags, and coin pouches are some of the most popular products, but you can get larger items like cork purses and backpacks as well. As taste in souvenirs has changed, artisans have adapted to meet the times by making cork phone cases, sunglass holders, and more!Porto and Lisbon are the best two cities to shop for Portugal cork products. It’s definitely a good idea to look around a bit though because quality varies. Pelco and Cork & Co are two of the better shops in Lisbon to check out for cork souvenirs.</div>

A lot of shops can be found around famous Portuguese landmarks which use azulejos in their architecture and design.Just remember to be careful when packing the tiles. Make sure they’re well wrapped and preferably tucked securely under several layers of clothing – you definitely wouldn’t want them damaged on your flight home!</div>

					<div class="title0">1.Casa Amora</div>
					<div class="paragraph0">Set along a pretty road polished with quintessential Lisbon tiles, in the inventive neighborhood of Amoreiras, is this townhouse with a bunch of rooms. From its garden (a high-walled cavern of disintegrating blocks and ivy) voices ever-burble, with visitors eating unstable custard tarts for breakfast and staff prescribing neighborhood eateries and strolls, all under the shade of a gigantic avocado tree. The stylistic layout is exquisite retro, the palette distinctly quieting – suitable given it's so near the absolute best lanes for shopping, including the Avenida da Liberdade and Rua de São Bento for absurdly extravagant and must-see collectibles. It is the perfect place for shopping in Portugal.</div>
